# Icons

For web interface icons, we use the [Google Material Design](https://materialdesignicons.com/) library and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). When representing products or resource categories, we use a custom icon library created by the Pega Creative Services team.

When using icons in a layout, be sure to only use them to add meaning to the information on the page. For product, resource and industry icons, avoid "doubling up" icons when categories overlap; for example, a page describing Pega Customer Service for Insurance should use the Product icon for Customer Service, but not the Industry icon for Insurance. 

Icons that signify an action a user should take should always appear with a clear label that describes the action they facilitate, [to enhance the usability of the icons](http://uxmyths.com/post/715009009/myth-icons-enhance-usability). The only exception to this rule is social media sharing icons; these can be used together with a single label (i.e. "share this page:") that applies to all the icons.
