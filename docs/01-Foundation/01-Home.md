# Pega Digital Design Standards

**A visual style guide and pattern library governing Pegasystems' digital properties.**

The Digital team at Pegasystems creates, maintains and continuously improves the websites that help people learn, build with, sell and buy Pega applications. The digital properties we work on span internal and external audiences across offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. This guide is designed to facilitate creating consistent, useful and usable design across all of Pegasystems' digital properties. 

> The reality is that the Web is a fluid, bi-directional, interdependent medium. As soon as we come to terms with this fact, the notion of the page quickly erodes as a useful means to scope and create Web experiences.

## Purpose of this guide

By creating a library of reusable UI components and visual standards, we achieve a few important goals:

- We can **create consistency** among our web properties while still respecting the unique needs of each site;
- We can **design and develop more efficiently** by providing code examples, reusing components and prototyping directly in the browser where possible;
- We can **resolve communication issues** between designers, developers and stakeholders by referencing existing patterns in prototypes and layouts.

## Principles

The following principles guide the work of the Digital team. We view these principles as directives from the people we serve every day - those who buy, sell and build with our products.

### Design for my needs, not your organizational structure.

When I have a need, whether it's finding a job to apply for or solving an urgent development problem, I shouldn't have to worry about which department I have to deal with, or which website I have to go to. Provide a seamless experience whenever possible, and organize things according to my mental understanding of them, not your organizational silos.

### Make it easy for me to find my own answer.

When I'm in the middle of trying to solve a problem, I don't want to have to wait for someone to answer my question or acknowledge my post. I need an immediate answer. Prioritize search, and help me recognize which content will actually help me solve my problem. Don't make me talk to someone, or file a support request, unless I have to.

### Help me be more efficient by using consistent design patterns I recognize.

My prior experiences with other websites and products inform how I navigate any new digital experience. By recognizing and utilizing the conventions people have grown used to over years of using the web (e.g. user-related navigation underneath your user icon, checkmarks to indicate success, etc.), you can make it easier for me to find my way around, helping me get what I'm looking for faster.

### Help me feel like I’m in control of my experience.

When I'm confronted with unexpected behavior or content I didn't ask for, I get anxious and frustrated - and I get less value out of their experience. Minimize disruptions to the flow through a task, provide messaging to help me understand and recover from errors, and provide signposts to help me recognize where I am in the site.

### Engage beginners and attract experts.

Learning a new technology is challenging, and I need help getting over the learning curve without feeling stupid. Help me gain mastery by providing clear guidance and a path to follow; as I get better, give me new challenges to keep me interested and engaged. Most of all, give me incentives to pass what I've learned along to others.
